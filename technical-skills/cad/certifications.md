## CAD Certifications

### Introduction

A list of certifications that are ideal for students going through the MSSA Cloud Application Developer learning path.

### Certifications

[**MCSA: Web Applications**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcsa-web-applications-certification.aspx)  
One of two MCSA tracks for developers, the Web Applications certification is most closely aligned with the topics you'll be studying and the exams you'll be taking throughout the MSSA CAD track.

[**MCSD: App Builder**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcsd-app-builder-certification.aspx)  
A logical next step after completing your MCSA: Web Applications certification (see above), the MCSD adds an extra layer of credibility and experience as you take an additional elective exam of your choice.

[**CompTIA Project+**](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/project)  
For those who donâ€™t have the recorded hours or time to invest in pursuing a PMP certification, this introductory cert from CompTIA provides a great introduction and foundation for a project management path.

[**PMP**](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/types/project-management-pmp)  
Highly regarded and well-respected in the industry, the Project Management Professional (or PMP) certification is ideal for candidates who have previous project management experience and are serious about pursuing a career in this field.
