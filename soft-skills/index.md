## Soft Skills Home

### Introduction

Welcome to the soft skills resources section of the MSSA Blog project!

Career guidance is an extremely important part of the MSSA curriculum, and students dedicate a significant amount of time to preparing for job interviews.  The pages in this section should provide additional resources to help with these efforts!

### Content

Soft skills resources are currently organized into the following pages (links will be enabled as each page is ready to view):

* Elevator Pitch
* Resume Guidance
* Networking and LinkedIn
* Company Research
* SOAR Stories
* Job Interview Prep
